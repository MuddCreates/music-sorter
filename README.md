# music-sorter

This is an exploratory project to investigate the task of sorting
music files by various metrics that might relate in some way to the
music's "mood". Because of the exploratory nature of the project,
there a number of different sub-projects included in this repository.
For more information on each, see the `README.md` included in each
subdirectory. For general documentation, see the `docs` subdirectory.

* `music-sorter`: An attempt to parse MIDI files in Clojure.
