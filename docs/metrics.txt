Metrics to track:
	1) 	tempo (easy-medium?) for reference, tempo is the "speed" of a song; the frequency of "beats"
		i) 	find the downbeats--should be pressure spikes at regular intervals.
		ii)	track the frequency and extremity of tempo modulations.  Possibly try to quantify how "jarring" the changes are too.

	2) 	chord related things (medium-hard?) for reference, a chord is a harmonic (i.e., composed of multiple sumperimposed pitches) set of
		pitches consisting of some number of notes.  Sometimes, the chord will be decomposed into individual notes (arpeggiation), or into 
		groups of notes, played by different voices.  A chord progression is some list of chords that, when played sequentially, transitions
		through some sort of "distance" away from the tonic (root note), returning (at least usually) to the tonic to give a sense of 
		"resolution."  

		In an 8-note scale, we use the following terms to describe notes.  This table is a 12-semitone scale thing, so notes congruent mod 12 
		are the "same" note shifted up.  In terms of physics, this means that the frequency of one is 2^n times the frequency of the other, 
		where $n\in \mathbb{Z}, n\neq 0$.  Or, that you can fit an even number of wavelengths of one inside one wavelength of the other.  
		The following table is adapted from wikipedia.  Can re-index
		_____________________________________________________________________
		|Note #	 |	Name	 |e.g.(Mj)|Meaning....
		| 0+*/12 |Tone		 |	C	  |Tonal center, note of final resolution
		|	11	 |Leading	 |	B	  |Melodically strong affinity for and leads to tonic/One half step below tonic in Major scale and whole step in Natural minor.
		|	10	 |			 | A#/B♭  |Sorta same as the other ones that're same
		|	9	 |Submediant |	A	  |Lower mediant, midway between tonic and subdominant, (in major key) root of relative minor key
		|	8	 |			 |	G#	  |Same as F#/G♭
		|	7	 |Dominant	 |	G	  |2nd in importance to the tonic.  Sounds very resolved 
		|	6	 |			 | F#/G♭  |Doesn't sound "harmonic" with the tonic but not super dissonant either.
		|	5	 |Subdominant|	F	  |Lower dominant, same interval below tonic as dominant is above tonic.  Creates a bit of tension when played with tonic.
		|	4	 |Mediant	 |	E	  |Midway between tonic and dominant, (in minor key) root of relative major key. Sounds v harmonic when played with tonic.
		|	3	 |			 | D#/E♭  |Sounds "minor" when played with tonic?
		|	2	 |Supertonic |	D	  |One whole step (two semitones) above the tonic.  Somewhat dissonant.
		|	1	 |			 | C#/D♭  |Dissonant 
		|	0	 |Tonic		 |	C	  |Tonal center, note of final resolution
 		*the + indicates that this note is up an octave, but in the same equivalence class mod 12 as whatever number precedes it. This notation is my own, so so don't
 		 count on seeing it around too often?  Also, usually I believe indexing starts at 1, but I thought this would help avoid off-by-one errors, and also make the 
 		 modular relationships more apparent.  

		Chords can be (partially) classified by the number of notes they contain.  A 3-note chord is called a triad.  Here is some info about 
		the diatonic functions (certain types of triads) that can be formed with the degrees (the named notes above; i.e. none of 2,4,7,9,11) 
		as roots.  The capitalization is both intentional and important!
		_____________________________________________________________________
		|Chord#(Mj.)|	Name					|Notes	 |Character
		|	I		|Tone						|0+,4+,7+|
		|	vii		|Leading tone/Subtonic**	|11,2+,5+|
		|	vi		|Submediant/Tonic parallel	|9,12,4+ |
		|	V		|Dominant					|8,11,2+ |
		|	IV		|Subdominant 				|5,9,12	 |
		|	iii		|Mediant/Dominant parallel*	|4,7,11	 |
		|	ii		|Supertonic/Subdominant par.|2,5,9	 |Distinguish chord V as a "goal" of motion (music "feels" tugged towards dominant).  This is because ii lies 
		|			|							|		 |a fifth above the dominant, and descending fifth's sounds very "strong" and natural.  In fact, ii is one of the
		|			|							|		 |strongest ways to get to V. Adding a chordal seventh (i.e., the root of the chord plus 7, e.g. if tonic is 1, 
		|			|							|		 |we'd add an 8) makes this feel more intense, and makes us feel tugged towards resolution more.  More on wiki-
		|			|							|		 |pedia about why this is
		|	I		|Tonic						|0,4,7	 |
		*also called Tonic counter parallel 
		** OFTEN referred to as incomplete Dominant seventh 
		OK I haven't finished this but the point is that chord progressions will be super helpful in quantifying the character of a piece.  In that light, some paths of inquiry:

		i) 	Finding out what key (i.e., what scale the song resolves around) our mp3 is in.  A Crappy starting-point approximation--look at the first note of the song, 
			and see if it makes sense that that note is 	the tonic
		ii) Identify chords within the mp3
		iii)Look at distributions between the chords, and transitions from chord to chord.  Possibly use a Markov model? 
			structure here would be a little more long-term than just first order.
		iv)	And/or, look at how long it takes for chords to be resolved, and/or the average distance between chords on the circle of fifths.  
			(maybe this is its own R^n walk problem?)
		v)	On a related note, we could also look at how strong cadences (rhythmic/harmonic endings to phrases) are
		vi)	Track number of accidentals (modulations to a different key), and how they are distributed.
		vii)Carefully track the degree of musical "tension" in the progression, and attempt to quantify it.  Some progressions might avoid resolving for a while, but 
			still not create a lot of tension in the meantime.  

	3) 	frequency distributions and/or overtones (easy)
		i)	looking at the frequency / overtone distributions would help us to determine what the notes "sound like" in this song.  E.g., a violin playing an A is 
			different sounding than a piano doing the same thing.  Overtones play a significant role in that.  
		ii)	Could possibly try to track the number of distinct voices (probably hard) and track how much each of them moves around.  Might be hard to separate 
			out the voices without fourier analysis?  

	4) 	Dynamics (how loud or quiet something is) 
		i)	Similar to tempo.  Find how _much_ the dynamics change (on average), and over what kinds of time intervals.  Could also try to 
			do some curve fitting with pressure as a function of time then track residuals in other pieces. 
			
	5) 	_possibly_ the length of the song, but I think that should be avoided.  

	6) 	How self-similar parts of the song are--this seems like it could be computationally unfeasible, but perhaps we could try to look for 
		short-term repeating subunits of chords/themes throughout the piece.
